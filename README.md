# Train Time
We have created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 
Our app retrieves and manipulates information with Moment.js. 
This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and 
how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
